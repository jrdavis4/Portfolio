## PURPOSE

The goal of this project is to design my first ever website. It will act as my portfolio and "about me" page for anyone to visit and take a look at my current projects. The assignment is from the UNC Coding Bootcamp and is exercising the basic use of Bootstrap 4.5, CSS, and HTML. The design is intended to be responsive with minimal use of media queries. Enjoy!
